Rob's dotfiles
---

Main sources of inspiration
- https://github.com/holman/dotfiles *[generally got me started.  topic-oriented.]*
- https://github.com/wunki/wunki-dotfiles *[a make (not rake) based version that only installs the stuff that I want]*
- https://github.com/davidbrewer/xmonad-ubuntu-conf  *[very well documented xmonad setup]*

Ended up primarily using holman's dotfile implementation.

TODO: set zsh as terminal. set firefox / arora / chromium default pages
